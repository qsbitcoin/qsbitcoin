# QSBitcoin Implementation Status

## Summary

As of July 2, 2025, the quantum signature implementation is **100% complete**. All functionality is implemented and working:

âœ… **Working Features:**
- Quantum key generation (ML-DSA and SLH-DSA)
- Quantum address creation (P2WSH format)
- Receiving funds to quantum addresses
- Spending funds from quantum addresses
- Quantum signature creation and verification
- Unit tests pass
- Manual UTXO selection working
- Witness script parsing and InferDescriptor working
- Descriptor wallet integration complete
- Full transaction cycle tested on regtest

## Technical Details

### Issues Fixed (July 2, 2025)

1. **Buffer Overflow in QuantumPubkeyProvider**
   - Fixed incorrect assumption that CKeyID is 32 bytes (it's actually 20 bytes)
   - Changed from `std::copy(keyid.begin(), keyid.begin() + 32, ...)` to `std::copy(keyid.begin(), keyid.end(), ...)`

2. **Null Pointer Dereference in VerifyScript**
   - Fixed crash when ScriptErrorString was called with null serror pointer
   - Added null check: `serror ? ScriptErrorString(*serror) : "unknown"`

3. **Quantum Signature Algorithm ID Missing**
   - Fixed mismatch between signing and verification code
   - Signing code for P2WSH wasn't including algorithm ID in signature
   - Updated to prepend algorithm ID (0x02 for ML-DSA, 0x03 for SLH-DSA) to signature

### Files Modified (July 2, 2025)

1. `src/script/descriptor.cpp` - Fixed buffer overflow in QuantumPubkeyProvider and fixed MaxSatSize/InferScript
2. `src/wallet/scriptpubkeyman.cpp` - Fixed witness script population
3. `src/wallet/spend.cpp` - Fixed manual UTXO selection
4. `src/wallet/quantum_descriptor_util.cpp` - Fixed witness script parsing
5. `src/script/sign.cpp` - Fixed quantum signature format to include algorithm ID
6. `src/script/interpreter.cpp` - Fixed null pointer dereference in VerifyScript
7. `src/test/quantum_address_generation_test.cpp` - Fixed test to use RegTestingSetup

### Testing Results

Successfully tested on regtest network:
- ML-DSA address generation, receiving, and spending
- SLH-DSA address generation, receiving, and spending
- All quantum unit tests passing
- No crashes or errors during normal operation

### Performance Characteristics

- ML-DSA signatures: ~3.3KB (recommended for general use)
- SLH-DSA signatures: ~35KB (for high-security applications)
- Transaction fees automatically adjusted based on signature type
