# Quantum Fee Removal Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all custom fee logic from QSBitcoin to align more closely with standard Bitcoin Core. Quantum signatures now pay fees based purely on transaction size, with no special discounts or multipliers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Fee Constants (`src/policy/quantum_policy.h`)
- Removed `QUANTUM_FEE_MULTIPLIER` (was 1.5)
- Removed `ML_DSA_FEE_DISCOUNT` (was 0.10) 
- Removed `SLH_DSA_FEE_DISCOUNT` (was 0.05)

### 2. Removed Fee Calculation Function (`src/policy/quantum_policy.cpp`)
- Removed entire `GetQuantumAdjustedFee()` function
- This function previously calculated weighted average discounts

### 3. Updated Transaction Validation (`src/validation.cpp`)
- Removed quantum fee adjustment logic in `AcceptToMemoryPool()`
- Transactions now use standard fee calculation

### 4. Updated RPC Commands (`src/rpc/fees.cpp`)
- `estimatesmartfee`: Removed `signature_type` parameter
- `estimaterawfee`: Removed quantum discount calculations
- `estimatetxfee`: Removed quantum fee multipliers
- Removed quantum_policy.h include

### 5. Updated Test Suite
Removed fee-related tests from:
- `quantum_fee_tests.cpp`
- `quantum_consensus_tests.cpp`
- `quantum_witness_validation_test.cpp`
- `quantum_policy_edge_cases_test.cpp`

### 6. Updated Documentation
- Modified `CLAUDE.md` to remove fee discount references
- Documented that fees are now based purely on transaction size

## What Remains

### Essential Quantum Support (Kept)
- Quantum signature schemes (ML-DSA-65, SLH-DSA-192f)
- Increased weight limit for quantum transactions (1MB vs 400KB)
- Quantum opcodes and script validation
- Wallet support for quantum addresses
- P2WSH encoding for quantum addresses

### Why These Are Necessary
- Large quantum signatures require higher weight limits
- Quantum opcodes enable signature verification
- Wallet integration allows quantum address usage

## Test Results

### Verification Tests Confirm:
1. ✅ Quantum addresses can receive funds
2. ✅ Quantum addresses can spend funds
3. ✅ Fees are based on transaction size only
4. ✅ No fee discounts or multipliers applied

### Fee Comparison (from tests):
- ECDSA: ~1.41e-06 BTC (small transaction)
- ML-DSA: ~1.441e-05 BTC (~10x more due to larger signature)
- SLH-DSA: ~1.31e-06 BTC (varies based on transaction complexity)

## Impact

### Positive:
- Simpler fee calculation logic
- More aligned with standard Bitcoin Core
- No special economic treatment for quantum signatures
- Cleaner codebase with fewer custom modifications

### Considerations:
- Quantum transactions cost more due to larger size
- Users pay standard fees based on blockchain space used
- No economic incentive to use quantum signatures early

## Conclusion

The removal of custom fee logic successfully simplifies QSBitcoin while maintaining full quantum signature functionality. The implementation now follows Bitcoin's principle of fees based on resource consumption (transaction size/weight) without special cases or discounts.

Quantum signatures work correctly but users pay proportionally more for the additional blockchain space required by post-quantum cryptography. This is the most straightforward and Bitcoin-compatible approach.
