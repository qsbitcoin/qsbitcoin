# QSBitcoin - Quantum-Safe Bitcoin

A forward-looking fork of Bitcoin designed to be resistant to quantum computing attacks.

## Overview

QSBitcoin replaces Bitcoin's quantum-vulnerable cryptographic components with post-quantum alternatives while maintaining the core principles and functionality that make Bitcoin the world's leading cryptocurrency.

## Key Features

- **Quantum-Resistant Signatures**: Replaces ECDSA with NIST-approved post-quantum signature schemes
- **Future-Proof Security**: Implements cryptographic algorithms resistant to both classical and quantum attacks  
- **Smooth Migration Path**: Provides tools and timeline for users to migrate from Bitcoin
- **Bitcoin Compatible**: Maintains compatibility with Bitcoin's ecosystem where possible

## Development Status

ðŸš§ **Currently in Planning Phase** ðŸš§

See [QSBITCOIN_PLAN.md](QSBITCOIN_PLAN.md) for the comprehensive development roadmap.

## Quantum Threat Timeline

- **2024-2030**: Development and testing of quantum-safe implementation
- **2030-2035**: Early quantum computers may threaten exposed public keys
- **2035-2040**: Quantum computers likely capable of breaking Bitcoin's ECDSA

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with C++20 support (GCC 12.2+ or Clang 14+)
- CMake 3.22 or newer
- Boost libraries 1.73.0+
- SQLite3 3.7.17+
- Python 3.10+ (for build tools)
- libevent 2.1.8+
- Post-quantum cryptography libraries (liboqs - will be integrated in Phase 1.3)

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository (always use SSH)
git clone git@github.com:qsbitcoin/qsbitcoin.git
cd qsbitcoin

# Navigate to the Bitcoin source directory
cd bitcoin

# Clean any previous build
rm -rf build/

# Configure the build with CMake
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUILD_TESTS=ON

# Build the project (use -j for parallel builds)
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)

# Run unit tests to verify the build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```
